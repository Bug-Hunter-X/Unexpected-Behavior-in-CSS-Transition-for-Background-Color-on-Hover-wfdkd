The solution is to explicitly set the background color for the `li` element. The transition property then works correctly, ensuring a smooth transition between the background colors.

```css
li {
  background-color: lightblue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

li:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

This ensures that the browser has a defined initial state for the transition to work from.  Without this, the browser may not correctly register the transition.
