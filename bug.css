The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers. It intends to style a list item with a background color that changes on hover, but the transition effect does not work correctly. The background color changes abruptly instead of smoothly transitioning. 

```css
li {
  background-color: lightblue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

li:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```
